# VidSrc-Embeds-NoAds

**VidSrc-Embeds-NoAds** is a minimalist, serverless proxy built with **Node.js**, leveraging **Axios** and **Cheerio** to fetch and sanitize video embed content from **VidSrc**. Its goal is simple yet powerful: strip all ads from embedded players, returning a clean and safe iframe for use on any website or application.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Send a request to the endpoint:  
   ```
   /embed?url=https://vidsrc.in/embed/ID
   ```
2. The proxy fetches and processes the embed content.
3. It returns a clean, ad-free iframe ready for direct use.
